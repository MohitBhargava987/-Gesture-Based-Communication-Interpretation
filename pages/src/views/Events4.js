                   According to Census 2001, there were 2.19 crore persons with disabilities in India constituting 2.13% of the population. Physical and mental impairments result in disability. Attitudinal and environmental barriers hinder full and effective participation of persons with disabilities on an equal basis with others in society. Disability can be mitigated by changing our perception and by creating a more conducive environment.

The Republic Day tableaux 2013, of the newly set up Department of Disability Affairs, of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of India, portrays persons with disabilities as  equal citizens of the nation enjoying all fundamental rights and freedoms in an inclusive society.

The tableau showcases inclusion through a live cultural program, led by a DPO (Disabled Persons Organisation), Disabled Power Group. The group is an inclusive group which includes persons with disabilities and non disabled persons, performing to a song carrying a message of solidarity, celebration and dreams.  A sculpture on the side of the tableaux depicts inclusion in creative arts. Inclusion as citizens is represented through a picture of a woman holding different identity cards symbolizing equality between all. The tableaux carries the message that the needs of persons with disabilities are the same as other citizens, which has been represented by portraying the symbols of  various sectors like health, education, sports, recreation, religion, financial services on a revolving Rubik's Cube.

        One of the world's fiercest, most passionate advocate for the rights of people with disabilities, passed away unexpectedly on Sunday, March 4th, 2018.

We all paid the tribute to Late Shri Javed Abidi today afternoon on 18th March 2018 at Chinmaya Mission, Lodi Road, New Delhi.

Javed Abidi was the Honorary Director of the National Centre for Promotion of Employment Disabled People; and Global Chair of Disabled People's International. As we struggle to come to terms with the huge loss and void created by his sudden demise, let's also celebrate his life and remember him for the invaluable and unparalleled contribution that touched made to millions and millions of people with disabilities around the country and outside.

The event was started by keeping silence in memory of Javed Abidi and Mr. Som Mittal, Chairman, NCPEDP was the first speaker. Then Mr. Jagdish talked about his friendship and the starting days of formation of Disability Rights Group (DRG). Mr. Javed Abidiâ€™s sister,  Ms. Sheeba Abidi shared her personal experiences and read a letter from Mrs. Sonia Gandhi in tribute to Mr. Abidi. Mr. Shameer, Javed Abidiâ€™s nephew, read a poem written by Mr. Javed Abidi.

Mr. AS Narayanan, President (NAD) and Mr. Zorin Singha, Secretary (NAD) talked about Javed Abidiâ€™s guidance and how he was such a great support to the deaf community, and teaching and leading in the space of advocacy.

There were several video messages played sent by the people who couldnâ€™tâ€™ be present at the event, among those was one from Mr. Thawar Chand Gehlot, Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and tribute video by BRUT India on Mr. Javed Abidi life journey.

There was a pledge by the youth - Mr. Pradeep, Ms. Suvarna, Mr. Ankit, Mr. Armaan, Ms. Rupmani - to take forward the work of Mr. Abidi.

At the end of the formal event, it was open house for people to come up and share their tributes.

Above all, let us pledge to carry on his legacy. And that would perhaps be the best tribute we can pay to such an exceptional soul.
